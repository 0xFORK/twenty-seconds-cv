\aboutme{
  My ideal technology role is one in which every working day is like a hack-a-thon; where I’d be analysing, designing, debating, programming, testing and debugging a solution with a team of technologists who love tackling problems and finally releasing the product successfully to clients and engaging with them to gain feedback for improvements that could possibly be released as future enhancements, thereby, not only making a positive impact on client workflows but also improving product value.} %About me section}
