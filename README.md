# twenty-second-cv
An attempt at making a single page cv in Latex.

Based on:

 * https://github.com/spagnuolocarmine/TwentySecondsCurriculumVitae-LaTex
 * https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/entry-level-resume-template-latex/jsmpwkcwyntg

Learned how to create custom tikz logos and use them in a Latex file from here: https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/79595/146819

Thank you again internet for the hard but interesting lesson.
